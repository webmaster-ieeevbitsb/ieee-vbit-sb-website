              IEEE Hyderabad Section is one of the most active sections of IEEE
              in India. IEEE was formally introduced in Hyderabad on June 1981,
              when a group of engineers in Hyderabad decided to form an IEEE
              sub-Section here. This sub-Section was rapidly elevated to a full
              Section, in 1984 (the year of IEEE Centenary celebrations). All
              IEEE members, residing in the state of Andhra Pradesh and
              Telangana, India are automatically members of the IEEE Hyderabad
              Section. Our strength (in numbers) is 5924 members (as per the
              Hyderabad Section Report 2018). The Section has NINE Chapters -
              Computer Society (CS), Communication Society COMSOC)/Signal
              Processing Society (SPS), Computational Intelligence Society 
              (CIS),/Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS), CAS/EDS,
              Education Society, MTT/AP/EMC Societies, Power and Energy Society
              (PES)/Industry Applications Society(IAS)/Power Electronics
              society(PELS), Photonics Society, Technology and Engineering
              Management Society(TEMS) and TWO Affinity Groups - Women in
              Engineering (WIE) and Young Professionals (YP).
