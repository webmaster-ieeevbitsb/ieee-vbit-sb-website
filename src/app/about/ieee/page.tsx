              The IEEE - VBIT Student Branch was established in 2006 with an
              initial strength of 42 members. Its inception, the branch focused
              on conducting weekly activities within the college, leveraging
              events as platforms to promote IEEE and foster student engagement.
              In 2007, the branch had increased its activity frequency and
              ensured robust participation from students across the college. In
              2008, with a significant rise in member intake, the branch gained
              momentum, successfully organizing a workshop and a national-level
              technical fest.

              During this period, the branch began active communication with the
              IEEE Hyderabad Section and participated as volunteers in sectional
              activities. Notably, the branch took part in the All India Student
              Project Contest organized by the IEEE Hyderabad Section and
              secured first prize, highlighting its growing excellence.

              Since its inception, IEEE - VBIT SB has demonstrated sustained and
              appreciable growth, guided by a clear vision and mission. These
              consistent efforts culminated in the branch receiving the
              “Outstanding Student Branch Award” in 2010. Under the leadership
              of Chairperson Mr. Karthik Siddavaram, during whose tenure two
              awards were achieved, the branch’s excellence was further
              recognized as he was elevated to the position of Section Student
              Representative for 2011.
