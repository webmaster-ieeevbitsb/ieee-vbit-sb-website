              The primary objective of the R10 InfoMap is to provide IEEE members,
              leaders and volunteers with an interactive platform to find, reach
              and connect with each other over a visual medium. Additionally, the
              map provides users with an illustration of where each major meet -
              up or project in the Region is taking place thereby, enabling
              members to gain a summarized understanding of the
              opportunities/events available at their disposal throughout the
              year.
